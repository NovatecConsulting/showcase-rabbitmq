= RabbitMQ Showcase

Since RabbitMQ is increasingly being requested as an alternative to Kafka, Rabbit should be examined more closely for its advantages and disadvantages.
However, the focus of this repository should primarily be on getting to know RabbitMQ and AMQP (v0.9.1 and v1.0.0).

The overall goal should be to enable an Event Mesh with different protocols. This requires, among other things, the connection of RabbitMQ and the provision of AMQP endpoints.

[discrete]
=== Objective

RabbitMQ is a versatile message broker that supports various messaging patterns. These are to be implemented using small sample implementations:

* Competing Consumers
* Publish-Subscribe Channel

[discrete]
=== Prerequisites

A local RabbitMQ installation can be used to run the code.
Start a RabbitMQ Broker instance using Docker:

----
docker run --hostname my-rabbit -p 5672:5672 -p 15672:15672 rabbitmq:3
----

[discrete]
=== Tests and Setup

The project uses a https://www.testcontainers.org/modules/rabbitmq/[RabbitMQ testcontainer] to execute tests without the need of a local RabbitMQ instance.
After publishing your code to Github, build and test steps will be executed by a Github Actions pipeline.

Tests are written in Groovy using the https://spockframework.org/spock/docs/1.3/index.html[Spock Test Framework].

Pull requests will automatically trigger a new test run.

== RabbitMQ Basics

=== High-Level Model (AMQP 0.9.1): Queues, Exchanges, Channels

RabbitMQ uses the following model:

Publishers send their messages to exchanges which can be compared to postoffices or mailboxes. These messages are then
forwarded to one or more binded queues. Consumers can subscribe to queues or explicitly pull from them.

[discrete]
=== Exchanges

Exchanges route messages to one or more defined queues. There are four differnt types of exchanges:

* Direct exchange
* Fanout exchange
* Topic exchange
* Headers exchange

By default if no exchange is explicitly created, the broker will use the same name for the routing-key as for the queue
that the publisher wants to send the messages to.

[discrete]
=== Queues

RabbitMQ uses queues as a sequential data structure with the two primary operations of enqueueing and dequeueing.
The important features are:

* Queues in RabbitMQ use FIFO prioritization.
* Applications can select a queue name or can request the broker to generate a name. The latter can be done by passing
an empty string where a queue name is expected.
* Queue names starting with "amq." are reserved for internal use only.

A queue can be declared with the properties name, durability, exclusivity, auto-deletion and additional arguments.

[discrete]
=== Connections and Channels

On the technical side, clients have to connect and authenticate to a RabbitMQ node before they are able to publish or consume
messages.

Since there are some applications that need multiple connections, AMQP 0.9.1 offers to open one or more channels on a single
TCP connection. Like this, one TCP connection can be shared to save resources. The channels rely completely on the connection
which means that if the connection is closed, all channels will be closed as well.

One example for the usage of multiple channels are applications that use multiple threads. For those applications, it is
very common to open a new channel for each thread.

Exchanges and queues are completely independent of connections and channels. A client can publish to the same exchange
or consume from the same queue using multiple channels with one connection.

=== Queue Properties: Auto-deletion, Exclusivity, TTL and Durability

. auto-delete +
Queues declared with the auto-delete property will be deleted when all consumers have finished using it.
The last consumer can be cancelled explicitly (channel.basicCancel(consumerTag)) or by closing its
channel (session in case of SwiftMQ).
. exclusive +
Exclusive queues can only be accessed by the current connection.
Therefore, they are deleted as soon as the connection(!) closes.
It is not possible to declare an exclusive queue from an external connection.
This is also the reason why it is not possible to declare an exlusive queue using
the RabbitMQ Java client and to subscribe to it with an AMQP 1.0 client connection.
. TTL +
The TTL-property can be used to avoid deletion of queues in cases
when a consumer shortly disconnects and then re-connects to the queue.
The corresponding queue will only be deleted if it stays unused for the defined
time limit.
. durable +
Metadata of durable queues is stored on disk while metadata of transient queues is stored in memory.
Therefore, transient queues and their messages will not be recovered after node restart.

== Implementation of Messaging Patterns using RabbitMQ

The SenderApplication and ReceiverApplication make it possible to test the code via the command line. To test
the different implementations, the used libraries can simply be exchanged since both applications are accessing
the AMQPClient interface.

=== Competing Consumers

The Competing Consumers Pattern (also know as Point-to-Point) describes the scenario when one producer can publish
messages to a messaging queue. Those messages can be processed by any of multiple consumers while each message will only be processed once.

Further details: https://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/patterns/messaging/CompetingConsumers.html

The implementation of producers and consumers can be found at:

----
/src/main/java/rabbitclients/version091/competingconsumers/
/src/main/java/rabbitclients/version100/competingconsumers/
----

=== Publish-Subscribe

When using the Publish-Subscribe Pattern, one publisher can send messages to a queue from where they will be
consumed by EACH consumer that has subscribed to this queue. Usually, the subscribers need to be active
at the same time when the messages are delivered to the queue. The pattern is often compared to television
programs or radio stations where everybody can tune in and start consuming.

Further details: https://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/patterns/messaging/PublishSubscribeChannel.html

The implementation of producers and consumers can be found at:

----
/src/main/java/rabbitclients/version091/publishsubscribe/
/src/main/java/rabbitclients/version100/publishsubscribe/
----

The publish-subscribe implementation for AMQP 1.0 has some constraints and disadvantages which is why it probably
should not be used practically. See paragraph 4.8 for more details.

//*********************************************************************************
//AMQP 0.9.1
//*********************************************************************************

== AMQP 0.9.1

AMQP 0.9.1 is RabbitMQ's default protocol. There are various client libraries available that were developed by the
RabbitMQ team to support AMQP 0.9.1.

=== Competing Consumers: Eventdriven Consumer

Using an eventdriven consumer for the competing consumer pattern is considered as standard for RabbitMQ.
The basicConsume()-method uses the DeliverCallBack interface to notify the consumer as soon as a new message is available.
The consumer is not blocked while it is waiting for messages.

----
DeliverCallback deliverCallback = (consumerTag, delivery) -> {
   String message = new String(delivery.getBody(), StandardCharsets.UTF_8);

   System.out.println("Received '" + message + "'");
   try {
       messageHandler.accept(message);
   } finally {
       System.out.println("Done.");
       channel.basicAck(delivery.getEnvelope().getDeliveryTag(), false);
   }
;

channel.basicConsume(TASK_QUEUE_NAME, false, deliverCallback, consumerTag -> { });
----

Read more about this type of consumer https://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/patterns/messaging/EventDrivenConsumer.html[here].

=== Competing Consumers: Polling Consumer

The RabbitMQ client also provides the possibility to use a polling consumer which needs to actively ask for new messages.
The _basicGet()_-method directly returns when no message is available and does not offer to specify a polling timeout.
Because of this implementation, the consumer has to constantly poll for messages using a loop
which is highly inefficient and therefore not recommended.

----
GetResponse response = channel.basicGet(TASK_QUEUE_NAME, false);
----

== AMQP 1.0

=== Plugin Installation

RabbitMQ primarily supports AMQP 0.9.1 and uses a plugin mechanism to enable the use of AMQP 1.0.
To run the code, a RabbitMQ broker with the enabled plugin has to be started using the Dockerfile located in this directory:

----
docker build -f Dockerfile -t rabbitmq-amqp-1_0-enabled .
docker run --hostname my-rabbit -p 5672:5672 -p 15672:15672 rabbitmq-amqp-1_0-enabled
----

Alternatively, you can pull the image from Dockerhub:

----
docker run --hostname my-rabbit -p 5672:5672 -p 15672:15672 nadjahagen/rabbitmq-amqp-1_0-enabled:latest
----

IMPORTANT: Without exposing the ports explicitly, the application won't be able to connect to the broker.
A ConnectionRefusedException will occur.

=== Client Library

As already mentioned, RabbitMQ does not natively support AMQP 1.0. Therefore,
https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-java-client/issues/651[their Java Client does not support AMQP 1.0]
which is also not planned for the future.

The number of available Java clients that support AMQP 1.0 is still limited at the moment:

* https://www.swiftmq.com/docs/docs/client/amqp/[SwiftMQ]:
The plugin's developers tested the functionalities mainly using SwiftMQ.
* https://qpid.apache.org/releases/qpid-proton-j-0.33.8/[Qpid Proton-J]:
The documentation is not that detailed and does not provide examples.
* https://qpid.apache.org/components/jms/index.html[Qpid JMS]:
Uses Proton-J internally. According to the documentation, the plugin's developers could not establish a connection using Qpid JMS/Proton-J.
Nevertheless, a tested and working implementation can be found at /src/main/java/rabbitclients/version100/qpidjms.

This project focuses on the usage of the SwiftMQ library.

=== AMQP 1.0 Protocol

Important AMQP 1.0 message fields MUST not be set by the application because they are overwritten by the Producer:

* Header fields: durable, priority, ttl
* Property fields: messageId, to, userId

Additional fields that are provided by AMQP 1.0:

* Header fields: first-acquirer, delivery-count
* Property fields: subject, reply-to, correlation-id, content-type, content-encoding, absolute-expiry-time, creation-time

A short comparison of the AMQP 0.9.1 and AMQP 1.0 fields is also provided
in the https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-amqp1.0#message-properties-annotations-headers-etc[RabbitMQ plugin documentation].

[discrete]
=== Routing and Addresses

If no specific exchange or topic name is provided, the messages are sent to the default exchange with the queue name
as routing key.
To specify exchange, topic or queue names, the address schema like described in the
https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-amqp1.0#routing-and-addressing[plugin documentation] can be used.

AMQP 1.0 was developed to be universally applicable and therefore does not know concepts like topics or queues.
When creating a producer or consumer, addresses can be used to set the target/source of messages:

----
com.swiftmq.amqp.v100.client.Producer producerInstance = session.createProducer(/topic/my_routing_key, qos);
----

In the example above, the producer sends all messages to the _amq.topic exchange_, from where
they are then further distributed to all queues with the binding _my_routing_key_.

[discrete]
=== Frame Sizes and Session Windows

For each connection, a maximum frame size has to be set to make sure that the sender/receiver has enough capacity
to process the message. Messages that are too large for one frame will be split internally by SwiftMQ into multiple frames
forming one so-called "Delivery".

The frames are buffered in an outgoing/incoming session window with a limited size. Before they can be consumed as an
AMQPMessage, the frames are put together again internally. The protocol implementation and the RabbitMQ plugin handle
the frame sequence and lost frames according to the quality of service. Therefore, this does not need to be handled
by the Java Client.

[discrete]
=== Settlement and Quality of Service

There are three different qualities of service available for clients:

. *At-Most-Once / Fire-and-Forget*  +
Sent messages are already in the state "settled". The sender won't wait until the receiver has successfully
received the message and will immediately forget about it. If the message is already settled, the receiver will never send an acknowledgement because
even if it would do so, the sender would already have forgotten about the message.
. *At-Least-Once* +
The sender waits for a reply before it marks the message as settled.
Released and modified messages are sent again. In case the receiver or sender fails,
the link can be re-established: The nodes compare their unsettled messages, update their states accordingly,
eventually re-sent the frames and clean their buffers.
. *Exactly-Once* +
According to AMQP 1.0, sender and receiver must be able to renegotiate the delivery status in order to
ensure "Exactly-Once"-quality. RabbitMQ does not support this concept.

=== Competing Consumers Pattern

In contrast to the RabbitMQ client, SwiftMQ implements a polling consumer, i.e., the consumer has to ask explicitly for messages.
To avoid blocking, it is possible to use the `receiveNoWait()` method that also provides the option to add a message listener.


=== Publish-Subscribe Pattern

AMQP 1.0 does not know concepts like queues or topics. The target (or source) of a message has to be specified using
the address-field of an AMQP 1.0 message like it is described in the https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-amqp1.0#routing-and-addressing[plugin's documentation].


Since this concept does not exist in AMQP 1.0, the SwiftMQ Java Client does not offer the possibility to manage
queues, topics and bindings like it is possible with the RabbitMQ Java Client for AMQP 0.9.1. Therefore, exchanges
and queues need to already exist when the application is started or can be created using RabbitMQ's REST API.

The publish-subscribe pattern requires one queue for each subscriber. The publisher sends all messages to a fanout
exchange from where they will be broadcasted to all queues with a corresponding binding. Since the queue name is
different for each subscriber, the name has to be passed into the program (if the queue already exists) or
the queue has to be created within the application via the RabbitMQ REST API.
Both possibilities come along with advantages and disadvantages which is why SwiftMQ and AMQP 1.0 are probably not
suitable for the publish-subscribe pattern.

In this repository, the Setup-class implements methods for the creation of exchanges, queues and bindings via REST.
The entities that are created with HTTP methods are not client-bound and therefore cannot be created as "exclusive".
Automatic deletion can be achieved through other queue properties like auto-delete and TTL (see root README for more details).
In addition, the REST API does not offer to create queues without names to let the broker choose a (temporary) unique
queue name. This leads to the constraint, that unique names have to be managed by the application.

=== Error Handling

A ConnectionClosedException will occur if the plugin is not enabled for the RabbitMQ broker.
The connection will be refused because of conflicting AMQP protocol versions:

----
com.swiftmq.amqp.v100.client.ConnectionClosedException: java.io.IOException: End-of-Stream reached

    at com.swiftmq.amqp.v100.client.Connection$2.run(Connection.java:432)

    com.swiftmq.amqp.v100.client.UnsupportedProtocolVersionException: Incompatible AMQP protocols. Local=[ProtocolHeader, name=AMQP, id=0, major=1, minor=0, revision=0], remote=[ProtocolHeader, name=AMQP, id=0, major=0, minor=9, revision=1]
    ...
----

To resolve this, enable the plugin like described above at _Plugin Installation_.


== AMQP Version Interoperability

=== AMQP 1.0 to AMQP 0.9.1

If messages are sent by an AMQP 1.0 client and consumed using an AMQP 0.9.1 client, the consumer will get the message
with extra bytes in the beginning.

*Example:*

* Sent message: M1
* Received message: �w�M1

These extra bytes are added by the client when the message is encoded into an AMQP-value or AMQP-sequence.
To be able to read messages that were encoded in this way, the AMQP 0.9.1 client would need a corresponding decoder.

The AMQP 1.0 protocol offers to send the message in the body section as AMQP-value, AMQP-sequence or as plain bytes.
According to this definition, it would be possible to send the messages in byte-format so that the
AMQP 0.9.1 clients do not need to decode them additionally. Unfortunately, the SwiftMQ client does only offer to
send messages as AMQP-values or -sequences and not as plain bytes.

=== AMQP 0.9.1 to AMQP 1.0

When messages are sent in AMQP 0.9.1 format, the plugin extracts the payload bytes and transforms them into an
AMQP 1.0 message. This means that the payload is transferred in the data section of the AMQP 1.0 message.
The receiving client then needs to transform the bytes into the desired data type.

As mentioned in the paragraph above, the SwiftMQ client does not offer a method to send data in the data section
of AMQP 1.0 messages. In contradiction to this, it is possible to read data from the data section and therefore,
to receive messages that were sent using AMQP 0.9.1.
